# Thrive AI research notes (Jan 2026)

## Findings
- I could not find a clear, reputable company profile for "Thrive AI" in the search results.
- The closest match returned consistently was **ThriveTogether**, a mental-health peer support application project.
- Sources referenced describe ThriveTogether's architecture (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + OAuth2/JWT + Docker) but do not confirm a company named Thrive AI.

## Sources reviewed
- https://github.com/ClarisseNicole8/ThriveTogether
- https://github.com/wsrn829/ThriveTogetherAPI
- https://github.com/wsrn829/ThriveTogetherDeployment

## Recommendation
If you meant a different "Thrive AI" (company, startup, or product), provide the official website or location so I can do targeted research.
